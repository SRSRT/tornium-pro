User Discord ID Tutorial
========================
Many users, especially newer users, may have issues when first using Tornium where their Discord ID won't be in Tornium's database. And because of that, when they attempt to use a slash command, the bot can't determine who they are in Torn. You can follow the below instructions to make sure that your Torn and Discord accounts are linked in Tornium's database.

.. note::
   All of these methods require the user to first be verified on the `official Torn Discord server <https://www.torn.com/discord>`_. 

If the server the user is in has verification set up with Tornium, the user can use the verify slash command to link their Torn and Discord accounts.

If the server does not have verification set up or uses some other bot (such as YATA) for verification, the user can do one of the following:
- Sign into Tornium with their Torn API key or through the Discord log in
- Use the ``/user`` slash command against their user (e.g.  ``/user member: @tiksan``) to link their Torn and Discord accounts.
